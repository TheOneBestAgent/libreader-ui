## What "Cliche Multiverse" Means in This Context
The phrase "cliche multiverse" is a **test search term**, not necessarily an actual novel title. It's used to test search functionality because:
- It contains common words in light novels (multiverse, cliche)
- It's a recognizable trope in the genre
- It tests the search algorithm's ability to find relevant results
